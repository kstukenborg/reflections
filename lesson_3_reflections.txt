When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This is convenient if you are using multiple machines to code or have other people working on your project.  In addition,
it is an easy way to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If am testing something out and don't want it available to everyone else in my project yet, I won't want to have it up on github.  Pushing 
manually allows me to pick and choose what I would like to share.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork is a clone on github.  You use this if you don't have access or another's
project and you want to make changes to it.
clone is a copy of a repository.  You can clone something from github to your 
local machine, or something on your local machine to your same machine.
Branches are when you are making changes on a single repository but maybe you are doing something experimental or different that you don't want in the main line of code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This is useful if I'm going to be without internet access and I want to update
my local copy before I go offline. I may want to do this before I merge it with
my own changes.  It is possible to do a merge offline.
